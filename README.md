<strong>Project Description:</strong>

Foreclosed properties are auctioned back to the public when the previous owners have gone delinquent on commitments. Local governments depend on property taxes to fund public services such as roads and education. Tax foreclosures are a method of ensuring payment and maintaining public service operations budget. Foreclosed properties also provide investment opportunities for prudent real estate speculators. Unfortunately, data does not disseminate in a structured manner. Listings vary state-by-state and county-by-county. Auctions can occur monthly, semi-annually, annually etc. Property evaluation variables come from multiple-unaffiliated sources as well. We want to develop a cohesive database that is fastidious, robust, and manageable with purpose of optimizing opportunities for speculators.
